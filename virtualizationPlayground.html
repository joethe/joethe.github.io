<h1>Playing with virtualization</h1>
<p>
    Being a novice when it comes to servers and linux, I found that I was spending an abysmal amount of time reinstalling things on physical machines
    after breaking various things in my feeble attempt to learn. Always looking for a means by which to do less work, I decided to look into virtualizing all of my
    projects.
</p>
<p>
    I began by throwing together some spare parts and an AMD FX6300 (6 cores!) which included a free motherboard as a part of a combo. The result is an abomination with the following
    specifications.
</p>

<ul>
    <li>CPU: AMD FX6300 6 core 3.5GHz</li>
    <li>Motherboard: (will update when I find the box, but it's nothing special)</li>
    <li>Memory: 4GB of generic DDR3 (single stick)</li>
    <li>Storage: 500GB generic hard drive</li>
    <li>Case: (will update when I remember...)</li>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Operating System: <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/proxmox-ve">Proxmox VE</a></li>
</ul>

<p>
    As I'm sure you can see the specifications for this server are far from impressive; it's physical appearance being even less so. However, it still
    serves adequately as a means by which to experiment with virtualization.

<h3>Why Proxmox, Why Not VMware?</h3>
<p>
    I choose Proxmox primarily because of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvDMLNAxYbI">this</a> Tek Syndicate video. Another reason for my choosing
    Proxmox is that I felt starting out with VMware would be too easy, considering that I wasn't planning on doing anything advanced or complicated for quite
    some time. That said, now that I've played with Proxmox for awhile I think I can better appreciate VMware; if only for its widespread compatibility.
