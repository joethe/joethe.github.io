  <h1> Home Lab </h1>

  <div class="row">
    <div>
      <p>
        Calling it a "lab" may be a bit of a stretch, but that's what I like to
        think of it as. This is a description of my humble collection of
        computing equipment.
      </p>

      <h3>Storage Server</h3>
      <p>
        Born partly of a genuine need for more storage, and partly of a
        desire to further separate my storage from my desktop computer and
        whatever ailments befall it. Currently, I trust my data to a bargain-bin
        motherboard sporting an AMD Phenom II X2 560 processor with a whole
        2 cores, running at a whopping 3.3 GHz. All of this is housed in a cheap
        4U rack-mount case with some hotswap bays. It runs CentOS, and the data
        is kept (relatively) safe by <a href="www.snapraid.it">SnapRaid</a>.
      </p>

      <h3>PFSense Firewall</h3>
      <p>
        A dubious violation of University network usage policy, a little HP
        Compaq desktop salvaged from the dumpster serves as a firewall and
        router for my tiny little network, allowing me to isolate some of my
        stuff from the outside world while still keeping networking configurations
        on my individual pieces of equipment simple. Although, most importantly,
        in combination with a switch it allows me to connect more than one thing
        via wired Ethernet without making anyone too angry.<sup>*</sup>
      </p>

      <h3>Old HP Desktops</h3>
      <p>
        My intention was to set these up to compile a Linux kernel in parallel,
        hoping to speed up the process somewhat. This hasn't happened yet for a
        variety of reasons - primarily that I have nowhere to put them. I guess
        I haven't really found time or motivation to do any work that would require
        kernel compiling either.

      <h3>Virtual Environment</h3>
      <p>
        Not being a fan of having to constantly re-install operating systems
        when I inevitably screw them up while playing around, at some point I
        decided to dedicate some hardware to hosting a virtual-environment for
        running Linux containers and VMs.
      </p>

      <ul>
          <li><b>CPU:</b> AMD FX6300 6 core 3.5GHz</li>
          <li><b>Motherboard:</b> (will update when I find the box, but it's nothing special)</li>
          <li><b>Memory:</b><strike> 4GB of generic DDR3 (single stick)</strike> Now it has 8GB of generic memory! (2 4GB sticks)</li>
          <li><b>Storage:</b> 500GB generic hard drive</li>
          <li><b>Case:</b>(will update when I remember...)</li>
      </ul>
      <ul>
          <li>Operating System: <a href="https://www.proxmox.com/proxmox-ve">Proxmox VE</a></li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Why Proxmox? Why Not VMware?</h3>
      <p>
        I choose Proxmox primarily because of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JvDMLNAxYbI">this</a> Tek Syndicate video. I like open source things, and make an
        attempt to use them whenever possible as I seem to learn more using them than when using their (usually) more popular counterparts. However now that I've used Proxmox
        a bit I feel that I can better appreciate VMware, and will try messing around with it in the future.

    no longer need to worry about University network policy...
