  <h1>MICS Robotics (2015)</h1>
  <p>
    As in 2014, I am participating in the MICS Robotics contest. I am working with a team of 4 others to design and construct a small
    robot to complete a challenge. This year a bit unique because the challenge is essentially the exact same thing that it was last year.
  </p>
  <p>
    To clarify, the only real change between last year this year, is the addition of a rule requiring that a ball make contact with the
    back wall of the field before it can be shot again. This rule would disqualify both the first and second place robots from last year.
    My team's 2014 robot, however, managed to take third place without resorting to questionable tactics; and could compete again this
    year without any modifications whatsoever.
  </p>

  <p>
    Although we could just reuse last year's robot again, and probably do quite well with it, we have decided to make an effort to redesign
    portions of it.
