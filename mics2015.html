  <h1>MICS Robotics (2015)</h1>
  <p>
    As in 2014, I am participating in the MICS Robotics contest. I am working with a team of 4 others to design and construct a small
    robot to complete a challenge. This year a bit unique because the challenge is essentially the exact same thing that it was last year.
  </p>
  <p>
    To clarify, the only real change between last year this year, is the addition of a rule requiring that a ball make contact with the
    back wall of the field before it can be shot again. This rule would disqualify both the first and second place robots from last year.
    My team's 2014 robot, however, managed to take third place without resorting to questionable tactics; and could compete again this
    year without any modifications whatsoever.
  </p>

  <p>
    Although we could just reuse last year's robot again, and probably do quite well with it, we have decided to make an effort to redesign
    portions of it.

  <h2> Robot Summary </h2>

      <h3> Structure </h3>
      <p>
        This year, as in 2014, our robot is primarily composed of Legos. We also made liberal use of cable ties. Major structual changes are:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reduced chain angle and shortened chain</li>
	<li>Added rubber band powered flipper mechanism</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
	The rubber band flipper mechanism was intended to improve upon our 2014 design by keeping the chain-based collection mechanism, but increasing its range. This addressed our problem with needing to get very close to the boundry line to shoot, which, due to the inaccuracies in our distance sensors, often resulted in being penalized for crossing the boundry line.

      <h3> Drivetrain </h3>
      <p>
        We reused last year's drivetrain with few, if any, physical modifications. It uses 4, independently driven mechanum wheels. Each wheel is driven by a lego NXT motor, which include encoders. It has the same flaws at it did in 2014; namely its tendency to slide towards the rear wall of the fild as it strafes sideways.

      <h3> Control </h3>
      <p>
        Like last year, we are using an NXShield-DX with an arduino.
