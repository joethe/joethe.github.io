Just messing around with sites. 
Trying to make a responsive but simple website that uses as few tools / frameworks as possible.

All the content (IE: Images, Videos, Large blocks of rambling text) belongs to me unless otherwise stated (if you think otherwise, please let me know!). 
Feel free to use the "theme" (CSS mostly) if you happen like it.
