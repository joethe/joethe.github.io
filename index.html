            <p>
                I'm a person living in the United States, who happens to be going to school for computer science at the University of Minnesota, Morris. For those of you who don't
                know, U of M Morris is the U of M campus located in western Minnesota; not the one in the twin cities. Silly cities, they don't even have cows there.
            </p>
            <p>
                Anyways... My interests vary wildly, from computer science to the manufacture of textiles; pretty much anything involving any form of technology, old or new. This results in my
                having far too many hobbies for my own good. I generally try to select only a few things per year to invest my time in,
                but I always make an effort to maintain an approximate knowledge of many things.
                Among the things that I have made a point of investing time in are robotics, electrical engineering, manufacturing,
                drones (multi rotor and otherwise), networking (IT), photography, graphic design, firearms and ammunition, various heavy machinery, psychology and, of course, computer science.

            <h1> Why does this website look so terrible? </h1>
            <hr>
            <!--<img src="assets/images/internet.png"/>-->
            <p>
                Well, perhaps "terrible" is a bit too harsh... The reason this site looks like an artifact of a bygone era is that it is based on a site
                that I worked on as part of a software design course. The goal of the assignment was, essentially, to create a decent looking site that was relatively responsive
                while using only basic HTML and CSS, with limitations on the number of CSS3 and HTML5 specific features that could be used. In the end my lab partner and I
                managed to fulfill those requirements, and I'm rather fond of the result. Although complicated frameworks and tools have their place, sometimes it's just nice to
                work without them; especially for a site like this where the only one editing the content is me, and said content does not need to change very frequently.

            <h1>What is this site for?</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
                I suppose it's here to provide a bit of information about myself to anyone who desires it; unless you're creepy. If you're creepy just go away or something. If you were hoping
                that this website would be super cool and awesome and shoot rainbows and sparkles and make you rich and stuff, then you're out of luck. The most entertaining thing this website
                is likely to contain is information regarding projects that I'm working on, which may be of interest to some people.

            This site, as it stands now, is almost entirely a copy of a small site I worked on with <a href="https://github.com/Jacoby04">Jacob</a> as
            part of a software design course.<br>
            I plan to eventually make many alterations, but for now it shall remain as it is with only the information it contains
            being altered.
