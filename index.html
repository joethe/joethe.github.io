            <p>
                I'm a college student working on a computer science major, and this is my website. Look around, click on some stuff or something. Most of what's on this
                page is filler, all the interesting stuff is on the projects page or on <a href="https://github.com/joethe">github.</a>
            </p>

            <p>
                Most of my interests are centered around robotics but I also enjoy programming, especially working with data to generate interesting / useful statistics, and designing useful systems
		and user interfaces for them. Although, as this website surely demonstrates, I need a bit of work on the visual aspect of the latter.
            </p>

	    <p>
		If you are a potential employer, please take a look at the "projects" page. That's probably what you came here to find. Also bear in mind
		that this website is a project in itself, and as such it is a little rough around the edges (but will always be usable). Thanks for taking a look at my stuff, by the way.

            <!--<img src="assets/images/internet.png"/>-->
            <p>
		Because it's a project. Not to say that all projects I work on look this terrible, but sometimes I become attached to horrible designs. I pitty them like
		sad little kittens, and I will continue to use them in the absense of any team members to remind me how ugly they are.

		That said, this website is my attempt to make a responsive site using as few tools and frameworks as possible, which I can maintain using only Github and VIM.
		So far I'd like to think it's turning out pretty well. There is text here, it is decently readable and can be organized into columns with little to no effort on my part, and 
		all I have to do is push more changes to github. Now all I need is spellcheck in VIM...

            <h1>What is this website for?</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
                It's a website that I threw together so that I would have a website to list on my resume. It also serves as something of an experiment, where I try to make a
                decent website without using generators or fancy frameworks such that it is still simple enough to be hosted on github with little to no effort on my part
                (other than creating the content).

                Yeah... Well, I'm working on it. Content first, horrible color scheme later.
