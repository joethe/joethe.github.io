                I'm a college student working on a computer science major, and this is my website. Look around, click on some stuff or something. Most of what's on this
                page is filler, all the interesting stuff is on the projects page or on <a href="https://github.com/joethe">github.</a>
            </p>

            <p>
                Most of my interests are centered around robotics but I also enjoy programming, especially working with data to generate interesting / useful statistics, and designing useful systems
		and user interfaces for them. Although, as this website surely demonstrates, I need a bit of work on the visual aspect of the latter.

            <p>
                Well, perhaps "terrible" is a bit harsh... The reason this site looks like an artifact of a bygone era is that it's based on a site
                that I worked on as part of a software design course. The goal of the assignment was, essentially, to create a decent looking site that was relatively responsive
                while using only basic HTML and CSS, with limitations on the number of CSS3 and HTML5 specific features that could be used. In the end my lab partner and I
                managed to fulfill those requirements, and I'm rather fond of the result. Although complicated frameworks and tools have their place, sometimes it's just nice to
                work without them; especially for a site like this where the only person editing the content is me, and said content does not need to change very frequently.

            <h1>What is this website for?</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
                It's a website that I threw together so that I would have a website to list on my resume. It also serves as something of an experiment, where I try to make a
                decent website without using generators or fancy frameworks such that it is still simple enough to be hosted on github with little to no effort on my part
                (other than creating the content).

                Yeah... Well, I'm working on it. Content first, horrible color scheme later.
