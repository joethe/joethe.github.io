                It's a website that I put here so that I would have a website to list on my resume. It also serves as something of an experiment, where I try to make a
            decent website without using generators or fancy frameworks such that it is still simple enough to be hosted on github with no little to no effort on my part
            (other than creating the content)

            <p>
                Well, perhaps "terrible" is a bit too harsh... The reason this site looks like an artifact of a bygone era is that it is based on a site
                that I worked on as part of a software design course. The goal of the assignment was, essentially, to create a decent looking site that was relatively responsive
                while using only basic HTML and CSS, with limitations on the number of CSS3 and HTML5 specific features that could be used. In the end my lab partner and I
                managed to fulfill those requirements, and I'm rather fond of the result. Although complicated frameworks and tools have their place, sometimes it's just nice to
                work without them; especially for a site like this where the only person editing the content is me, and said content does not need to change very frequently.

            <h1>What is this website for?</h1>
            <hr>
            <p>
                I suppose it's here to provide a bit of information about myself to anyone who desires it; unless you're creepy. If you're creepy just go away or something. If you were hoping
                that this website would be super cool and awesome and shoot rainbows and sparkles and make you rich and stuff, then you're out of luck. The most entertaining thing this website
                is likely to contain is information regarding projects that I'm working on, which may be of interest to some people.

            <p>
                Well, I went with three columns down here because I thought they looked nice... I can't actually think
                of anything to put here yet...
