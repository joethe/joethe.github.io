            <h1>Well hello there</h1>
            <p>
                I'm a recent college graduate with a Bachelors degree in Computer Science, and this is my website. Look around, click on some stuff or something. Most of what's on this
                page is filler, all the interesting stuff is on the <a href="Projects.html">projects</a> page or on <a href="https://github.com/joethe">github.</a>
            </p>

            <p>
                Most of my interests are centered around technology. Specifically, I am fascinated by robotics, automation, data collection and processing, and data centers, among other things.
                While most of these these things are outside the scope of my degree, I enjoy the fact that my Computer Science is applicable to nearly all of my interests.
            </p>

		If you are a potential employer, please take a look at the "projects" page. That's probably what you came here to find. Also bear in mind
		that this website is a project in itself, and as such it is a little rough around the edges (but will always be usable). Thanks for taking a look at my stuff, by the way.

              It's a website that I threw together so that I would have a website to list on my resume, and to serve as a portfolio of sorts. Check out the <a href="Projects.html">projects</a> page if you're
              interested in seeing what I've been working on.

                Yeah... Well, I'm working on it. Content first, horrible color scheme later.
