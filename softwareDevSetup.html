<h1> Software Design and Development </h1>
<h2> Setup and Support </h2>
<h1 class="subtext">2014-2017</h1>

<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>
    Following my completion of 3601: Software Design and Development in the Fall of 2014, I undertook a directed study in which I supported the Spring 2015 offering
    of that same course. I did this primarily by preparing project templates for the students' labs, as well as by helping my professor research the tools that the students
    would be using in their project and talking with the customer that the students would be working with in order to design their labs to teach concepts that would be critical
    during later work on their project. In 2016 and 2017 I continued to assist with the course as a TA.

		<h3> Goal(s) </h3>
		<p>
			To assist my professors in preparing materials for the Software Design and Development course, as
			well as with ensuring that students questions are answered during labs.
		</p>

    <h3> Course Progression </h3>
    <h4> Note </h4>
    <p>
      Some of the repositories linked here are still in active use, or at least continued to be
      used long after I was contributing to them. Some of them have changed substantially (probably
      for the better!), but the descriptions given here will remain accurate to the last time I contributed.
    </p>
    <h4><a href="https://github.com/UMM-CSci-3601/3601-lab1_HTML-CSS">Lab 1: HTML and CSS</a></h4>
    <p>
      Students are tasked with developing a simple static website using HTML
      and CSS.
    </p>

    <h4><a href="https://github.com/UMM-CSci-3601/3601-lab2_client-server">Lab 2: Client Server</a></h4>
    <p>
      Students are tasked with serving up a simple website using Spark Java,
      and expanding a basic API to support various searches for data in a
      fixed test dataset. Additionally, students must expand the frontend to
      allow interaction with this API. Students are also expected to write
      tests and integrate their project with Travis CI. Gradle is introduced
      as the build system in this Lab.
    </p>

    <h4><a href="https://github.com/UMM-CSci-3601/3601-lab3_angular-spark">Lab 3: Angular and Spark</a></h4>
    <p>
      Students will further expand the API they worked on in the previous lab,
      as well as adding better display and search capabilities to their
      front-end using Angular.
    </p>

    <h4><a href="https://github.com/UMM-CSci-3601/3601-lab4_mongo">Lab 4: Mongo</a></h4>
    <p>
      In this lab, the students will refactor their API to use a Mongo database
      rather than the static test data that had been used previously. Students
      must also add functionality to the API to generate various summaries
      of their data.
    </p>

    <h4> Final Project </h4>
    <p>
      Students will spend the remainder of the semester developing a web
      application for a customer, following an Agile process and working in
      progressively larger teams.
