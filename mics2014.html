<h1>MICS Robotics, 2014</h1>
<p>
    Apparently, every year there's this Midwest Instruction and Computing (MICS) thing, and a part of this wonderful
    event is a small robotics competition. The focus of this competition, much like many other robotics competitions,
    is on accomplishing what is usually a novel task with an autonomous robot. Small teams from a variety of schools
    participate.

    At the 2014 conference the objective for the robotics competition was to score baskets with little foam nerf-like balls, on a
    slanted playing field. The details of the challenge can be found in this pdf: <a href="http://micsymposium.org/mics2014/Robotics_Rules.pdf">http://micsymposium.org/mics2014/Robotics_Rules.pdf</a>
