<h1>MICS Robotics, 2014</h1>
<p>
    Apparently every year there's this Midwest Instruction and Computing (MICS) thing, and a part of this wonderful
    event is a small robotics competition. The focus of this competition, much like many other robotics competitions,
    is on accomplishing what is usually a novel task with an autonomous robot. Small teams from a variety of schools
    participate.
</p>
<p>
    At the 2014 conference the objective for the robotics competition was to score baskets with little foam nerf-like balls, on a
    slanted playing field. The details of the challenge can be found in this pdf: <a href="http://micsymposium.org/mics2014/Robotics_Rules.pdf">http://micsymposium.org/mics2014/Robotics_Rules.pdf</a>

        <p>
            The robots involved in this competition are relatively small and our school's team(s) tend to use Lego parts to build our robots, as we
            lack the capacity to really manufacture any of our own structural components.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2014, our school had two teams participate in the robotics competition. One team used the Lego NXT brick, programmed in java, to control their robot while
            the other team used an arduino instead. I was on the team using arduino. My primary responsibility on the team was electronics, which involved
            finding various ways to control Lego NXT parts with an arduino.

<h3>Drivetrain</h3>
<p>
    For the drivetrain we decided to go with mecanum wheels. We figured that the horizontal movement would make searching for and collecting balls on the playing field
    much easier. Another deciding factor was the fact that mecanum wheels are really cool. This turned out pretty well, the only real issue with the approach being that the
    robot tended to slide down-slope slightly when moving sideways. This unwanted movement could be compensated for slightly in code, but remains troublesome under certain
    circumstances.
</p>
<p> Each wheels was independently driven by a single NXT motor.</p>
<p>
    The wheels we used can be found <a href="https://secure.robotshop.com/en/lego-compatible-mecanum-wheels-4-pieces.html">here</a>. They work well, and are designed to work
    directly with lego stuff. The only gripe I have about them is the price, and that the rubber on the rollers tends to wear out quickly when used on rough surfaces such as
    plywood.
</p>

<h3>Control System</h3>

<p>
    Our need to control NXT parts with an arduino was mostly satisfied by an <a href="http://openelectrons.com/index.php?module=pagemaster&PAGE_user_op=view_page&PAGE_id=9">NXShield-Dx</a>,
    which was a joy to use. The documentation is pretty good and the provided libraries are relatively comprehensive and easy to work with. 

    Supplementing the NXShield-Dx and Arduino was a custom h-bridge, which added the ability to control one more motor (or a set of motors, operating together).
    This was needed due to the limited number of nxt motors that the NXShield-Dx can control (4), all of which were used by our drivetrain.  
</p>
<p> 
    Autonomous navigation and collection / shooting of balls was assisted by 3 NXT ultrasonic rangefinders; one on each side and one facing the downslope section of the playing field. 
    These sensors were controled by the NXShield-Dx.  
</p>

<h3>Scoring Mechanism</h3>
<p>
    Our scoring mechanism consisted of a belt / chain (made of lego parts) with a small platform to hold a ball. The belt is driven by two NXT motors controlled by the aformentioned h-bridge and two NXT
    buttons acting as limit switches. Picking up a ball was acomplished by lowering the platform to floor level and driving into the ball, pushing it against the downslope wall and up unto the platform. Shooting 
    the ball was acomplished by moving the platform rapidly upward and suddenly stopping, throwing the ball out in front of the robot and (hopefully) into the hoop.
