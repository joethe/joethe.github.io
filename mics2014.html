<h1>MICS Robotics, 2014</h1>
<p>
    Apparently every year there's this Midwest Instruction and Computing (MICS) thing, and a part of this wonderful
    event is a small robotics competition. The focus of this competition, much like many other robotics competitions,
    is on accomplishing what is usually a novel task with an autonomous robot. Small teams from a variety of schools
    participate.
</p>
<p>
    At the 2014 conference the objective for the robotics competition was to score baskets with little foam nerf-like balls, on a
    slanted playing field. The details of the challenge can be found in this pdf: <a href="http://micsymposium.org/mics2014/Robotics_Rules.pdf">http://micsymposium.org/mics2014/Robotics_Rules.pdf</a>

            The robots involved in this competition are relatively small and our school's team(s) tend to use Lego parts to build our robots, as we
            lack the capacity to really manufacture any of our own structural components.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 2014, our school had two teams participate in the robotics competition. One team used the Lego NXT brick, programmed in java, to control their robot while
            the other team used an arduino instead. I was on the team using arduino. My primary responsibility on the team was electronics, which involved
            finding various ways to control Lego NXT parts with an arduino.

<h3>Drivetrain</h3>
<p>
    For the drivetrain we decided to go with mecanum wheels. We figured that the horizontal movement would make searching for and collecting balls on the playing field
    much easier. Another deciding factor was the fact that mecanum wheels are really cool.
</p>

<p>
    Our need to control NXT parts with an arduino was mostly satisfied by an <a href="http://openelectrons.com/index.php?module=pagemaster&PAGE_user_op=view_page&PAGE_id=9">NXShield-Dx</a>
    which was a joy to use. The documentation is pretty good, and the provided libraries are relatively comprehensive and easy to work with.
