<h1>MICS Robotics, 2014</h1>
<p>
    Apparently every year there's this Midwest Instruction and Computing (MICS) thing, and a part of this wonderful
    event is a small robotics competition. The focus of this competition, much like many other robotics competitions,
    is on accomplishing what is usually a novel task with an autonomous robot. Small teams from a variety of schools
    participate.

    At the 2014 conference the objective for the robotics competition was to score baskets with little foam nerf-like balls, on a
    slanted playing field. The details of the challenge can be found in this pdf: <a href="http://micsymposium.org/mics2014/Robotics_Rules.pdf">http://micsymposium.org/mics2014/Robotics_Rules.pdf</a>

    As you can likely see from the above images, the robots involved in this competition are relatively small. Our school's team(s) tend to use Lego parts to build our robots, as we
    lack the capacity to really manufacture any of our own structural components.
